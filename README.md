# AI-Travel-Companion-for-the-Differently-Abled
Assists blind/deaf travelers in navigation

Traveling can be stressful for anyone, but for people who are blind, deaf, or have other disabilities, it can be even more challenging. Current navigation apps are not designed with their needs in mind, leaving major gaps in accessibility, safety, and independence.

The AI Travel Companion for the Differently-Abled is an Android-based application designed to empower blind and deaf travelers by providing them with real-time navigation, obstacle awareness, communication support, and emergency assistance. Unlike generic travel apps, this solution combines voice guidance, vibration cues, captions, and safety features in one accessible system, making travel safer, easier, and more inclusive.

Main Goals

Accessible Navigation:
Provide turn-by-turn navigation that adapts to the needs of differently-abled users.

Blind Mode: Voice instructions (TTS) + vibration cues.

Deaf Mode: On-screen captions + visual alerts.

Enhanced Safety:
Ensure that users can travel with confidence.

One-tap SOS button to share live location with caregivers/family.

Alerts for obstacles (basic AI object detection, if time permits).

Communication Support:
Help deaf travelers understand spoken announcements or conversations.

Speech-to-Text (STT) to display captions for real-time audio.

User-Centered Accessibility:

Simple UI with large buttons, voice commands, and haptic feedback.

Switchable modes: Blind Mode / Deaf Mode.

Scalable Future Vision (Optional for Pitch):

Crowdsourced accessibility data (ramps, elevators, barriers).

Indoor navigation for airports/malls.

Integration with wearables (smartwatches, canes, AR glasses).

Problem Statement

Millions of differently-abled individuals face daily barriers while traveling.

Blind users struggle with unsafe routes, unmarked obstacles, and inaccessible navigation tools.

Deaf users miss critical announcements in airports, train stations, or buses.

Families and caregivers often worry about their safety and independence.

This project addresses these challenges by designing an AI-powered mobile assistant that makes travel inclusive, safe, and stress-free.

Key Features (Minimal MVP)

Navigation: Google Maps SDK for route planning.

Blind Assistance: TTS voice guidance + vibration alerts.

Deaf Assistance: Real-time captions for announcements via STT.

Emergency SOS: One-tap button sends live location via SMS.

Expected Impact

Social Impact: Empowers differently-abled people with independence and dignity in travel.

Economic Impact: Expands tourism opportunities and reduces reliance on costly human guides.

Environmental Impact: Promotes sustainable travel (walking, public transport) with accessible routing.

✅ In short:
The AI Travel Companion is not just another navigation app — it is a holistic accessibility tool designed to break barriers in travel for differently-abled people, making journeys safer, more independent, and more inclusive.
